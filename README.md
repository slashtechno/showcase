# [Podium](https://podium.hackclub.com/), a peer-judging platform for hackathons

## For Attendees

### Overview

Podium allows you, and your team members, to submit the project you’ve spent the past ~24 hours on. To get started, head over to [Podium](https://podium.hackclub.com) (podium.hackclub.com) and create an account. After you sign up, you’ll receive an email with a link, valid for fifteen minutes, allowing you to login. 

### Joining

To join an event, enter the join code given to you by the event organizer(s). It’s a ~4-character case-insensitive code that looks like “**AMXU**” or “**-PWJ**” and can be entered on the homepage. Upon joining the event, you’re now able to create a project. 

### Creating a project

You can create a project from the homepage, just fill out your project’s information and press “**Create Project”**. For everyone else on your team, they just have to enter the project’s join code, found in your project dashboard, into their project dashboard.

Please keep in mind that the hours field is just for statistics, so please be honest when filling it out. Also include your team members' hours!

### Updating projects

Made a mistake when creating your project? Decided to remake your project two hours before voting? No problem! Go to the project dashboard to update your event.

### Voting

To experience other attendees’ projects, and to vote on them, go to the events dashboard click on the “**Rank Projects**” button. From here, you’ll be able to visit project demos and view their repositories. To begin voting, select the top two or three projects (depending on the size of the event) that you like most. Then, submit your vote. Order doesn’t matter! 

### Leaderboard

Want to see current project standings? Head over to the leaderboard for the event you’re attending by going to the event dashboard and then pressing the “**Leaderboard”** button.

To set up your event, go to the events dashboard from the homepage, and create an event. You should see a join code, a ~4-character case-insensitive code that looks like “AMXU” or “-PWJ”, in the list below. Distribute this code to attendees to allow them to join!
